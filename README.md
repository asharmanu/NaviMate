## Introduction
Navimate is a dynamic platform designed to empower international students during their transition into new academic environments by offering customized support tailored to their unique needs. Leveraging advanced technologies like Google Maps and machine learning, the app seamlessly connects users with essential services including healthcare, health insurance, local markets, banking, off-campus housing, and public transportation. It also facilitates integration into local communities, enhancing students' cultural acclimation and ensuring a successful commencement of their academic journey.

## Problems
Students often encounter a spectrum of challenges upon entering a novel academic environment, particularly in a foreign country, such as language barriers, unfamiliar banking systems, and accessing specialized healthcareâ€”issues that can impede their academic success and well-being. 

Problem 1: Finding services
	Securing insurance, finding health services without a language barrier, navigating locations, discovering off-campus housing details, and finding an appropriate bank for students. 

Problem 2: Financial Burden
	Living alone brings both excitement and intimidation, with individuals potentially unsure about the nearby places that are cheap and buy affordable housing.

Problem 3: Academic and Career Services
	Challenges related to academics, class expectations, and exams
